# Sam Nolan's Confirmation Blog
This blog has notes about my confirmation and faith journey. Confirmation is the
process of being integrated as a member of a church, or in my case, the Uniting
Church of Australia. This blog will contain faith thoughts of mine and where I
am currently at in my faith journey, and for completing the homework that Suzie
sets for me from the belonging course.

In terms of a quick history. I was bought up in an atheist family, and I was 
originally agnostic. This version of agnosticism was a bit more strict. I at the
time called super agnosticism. Which basically claims that if the existance of
God is unfalsifiable, then that therefore means that there is no actual physical
consequence of believing in a God or not, we should behave in the same way and
work around the world in the same way.

I became Christian in November 2019 because after reading a lot of literature on
self development, I realised that possibly one of the best ways to improve yourself
was becoming Christian. I at the time thought the belief of God was akin to a
kind of super optimism, that from an atheist perspective it was similar to believing
that it will all work out in the end. However, I then realised that if this
is true this actually offers evidence for the existance of a God. So I converted to
Christianity.

Nowadays, I stay in the church, and particularly the Uniting Church of Australia,
because the only community I know that are more obsessed about doing good are
the [Effective Altruists](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). The UCA is the
largest body of non-governmental aid in Australia. I believe that the simple 
idea of "doing good" is much too secondary in the lives of people. There is nothing
more noble than the constant persuit of doing more good. I believe that a person's
life should be dedicated to this entirely, forgetting about passion, desires and
other such things.

My homework for this week is to look into other people's interpretation of faith.
I am planning to go to the anglican church this Sunday.

My current questions about faith are to do with it's relation to rationality.

I'll take rationality as the concepts derived from Rationality: AI to Zombies by
Eliezer Yudkowsky.

I went into faith from a rational perspective, based off unusual evidence for it's
existance. Such as:

- I came to the conclusion that one of the best ways to improve yourself as a person
  is to become Christian (or more specifically, believe in a God)
- Effective Altruism, and Christianity have unusual parallels. Such as
  - Not very popular notions of giving a lot of money to the poor. Christianity 
    seems to call for giving _everything_ to the poor/church, is in the 
    [Lesson from the Widow's mite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_of_the_widow%27s_mite),
    which is very similar to [Peter Singer's response on the demandingness objection of utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demandingness_objection#Singer's_response).
    These are both unlikely positions to hold.
  - An unusual level of selflessness that would be better called self-sacraficing.
    Although I recognize that atheists being selfish is a stereotype I must avoid,
    I mean things like "following your interests/passion/reason" to the self centeredness
    that's missing from both EA and Christianity.

However, there are some other issues. Most notably, the common idea of the
"unfalsifiablility of religion", which [Eliezer rejects](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fAuWLS7RKWD2npBFR/religion-s-claim-to-be-non-disprovable).
As well as a realization that because of this unfalsifiablility, I may have a
[belief in belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY/belief-in-belief).
A belief in belief is a belief I _say_ I have, but nevertheless predict that
situations will occur that falsify that belief. For instance, if I say that prayer
works to heal sicknesses, and someone asks me to test that theory in a controlled
fashion, I might say that "God doesn't like to be tested, it will probably come
out false". The very fact that even _before the test has been done_ I have predicted
failure and tried to justify my belief, means that I don't actually truly believe
that prayer works. If I did, I would simply ask to go ahead with the test and
see what it's results are.

There is an interesting chant that Harry get's Draco to do in [Harry Potter and
the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) that talks about this problem.
Harry is trying to convince Draco that magic might not actually be fading by
getting him to say this statement:

"If magic is fading, I want to believe that magic is fading. If magic is not fading, I want not to believe that magic is fading. Say it." - Harry Potter [Chapter 22](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/22)

In a religous context, it would be:

"If God exists, I want to believe that God exists. If God does not exist, I want to believe that God does not exist"

As of such, for me to truly believe in God, I need to know of some way that I
can falsify that belief, and then run that test. This would provide evidence for
that belief and I would find it justifiable. Or might not.

The even more horrifying concept is that ["You shall not test the lord your God"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_4:7).
The ideas that God himself will deliberately make tests about his existance fail
is a concerning thought. I am going to cross my fingers that this is not actually
true because otherwise it would give me a headache.

I've been thinking about this test, and there are a few considerations I want
to take into account:

- My partner and I are very familiar with a class of people we like to call "wankers".
  For the sake of this post, I'll define a wanker as someone who proposes and
  discusses solutions to problems with no actual intent on implementing those solutions, but 
  rather to make themselves seem intelligent. To quote Stephen Covey "to know,
  and not to do, is really not to know". The EA community looks very much like
  this at first glance, and can very quickly fall into this trap. I don't believe
  that God can be falsified from an armchair, so I at least need to look into a
  test that is practical and not theoretical.
- I therefore need to construct a test that where two different things will happen
  if there is a God in this world or if there is not, or at least, one is more likely
  to happen and the other is not. This is difficut to do considering the diversity
  of religous positions, and that so many other people take unfalsifiablility of
  religion very seriously.
- God is an entity of superintelligence. There are a wide array of tests that
  wouldn't work on humans if they [knew they were being tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).
  I will always assume God knows that I _am_ testing them, so I guess I need
  a respectful test.
- I would like the tests to be cheap. In that they are very easy to perform.

Here are some current ideas for some tests. I'll add to this list when I get 
more ideas:

- Jesus said don't worry about [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:26) and [clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:28), they will be provided to you
  when you need it by God. An atheist (as well as probably the majority of christians)
  might say that this is ridiculous and you need to provide for yourself to stay alive.
  This means that if for some reason, your basic needs are always met, this could
  offer evidence for the existance of God. This however, is a dangerous test to
  take.
- The effectiveness of prayer to cure disease seems to be [minor or non existant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercession#Studies). 
  This has already been researched


### Test 1, prayer and arbitrary probabilities
Ok, here's my first test. Does prayer actually make some outcomes more likely than others?

Reasoning: This test is too easy to perform to not try. So I will give it a go.

Hypothesis: Prayer will improve the probability of a coin tossing heads if I request
for God to make it heads.

Method:
I will pray the following prayer:
"Dear father in heaven, hallowed by your name. I ask you make this following coin
tosses heads, as to aid my investigation into your true nature. Amen"
Then toss the coin. I will do this 10 times and record the results. I will do
the entire process 10 times and record the amount of heads I get in each experiment

The prior for the number of heads is a normal distribution (which approximates a binomial distribution) 
with mean 5 and standard deviation sqrt(2.5). The actual result will then be the evidence and 
I will update by posterior accordingly

I must keep in mind that this could fail due to the Hawthorne effect. The test
may seem "disrespectful"

Results:

Test  Heads  Tails
----  -----  -----
1         6      4
2         2      8 
3         2      8
4         5      5
5         4      6
6         4      6
7         3      7
8         8      2
9         5      5
10        7      3

Average heads: 4.8

Offers no support for my hypothesis. There are several alternatives to explain this:

1. God does not exist, therefore prayer doesn't work
2. God does not work through prayer
3. God will not influence the probability of coin tosses
4. God did influence the probability of the coin tosses, but the effect is small and not noticable here
5. I did not pray in a fashion worthy of God

My favourite hypothesis is currently 3. But I'm going down the belief in belief
path if I do that.

### Jesus' authority on prayer
To take the leading authority on prayer (Our lord and saviour Jesus Christ),
he says on prayer (Matthew 6:5-15)

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing
in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you,
**they have received their reward in full**. But when you pray, go into your room,
close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what
it done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling
like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like
them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name

your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread.

And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly father
will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive their sins, your Father will
not forgive you sins.

---

This gives us:
 - Do not tell other people you are praying. If you do this it will be more likely
   to be fulfilled. Easy enough precondition to take.
 - Keep your prayers short and simple. Also easy enough.
 - Appropriate things to pray for include:
   - The coming of the kingdom of God
   - The enactment of God's will (which then asks what is God's will)
   - The provisioning of daily required resources
   - Forgiving of debts (Which is hard because I don't know how to test whether I have been forgiven)
   - To not be lead into temptation
   - Deliver us from the evil one (which I assume is Satan)

The easist to test now would be to _not be lead into temptation_. I'll assume this
refers to temptation into sin, which could include pride, envy, sloth, gluttony, 
wrath, lust, greed. Which are two relatively safe sins to pray to abstain from.

Including:
 - Prayer for me to overcome sloth and do work that needs to be done
 - Prayer for me to overcome gluttony and help me fast
 - Prayer for me to overcome sloth and wake up at the right time.

The problem with any of these tests is that there is an extreme experimenter's
bias, in that I would prefer the outcome to go one way (to support the hypothesis
that prayer does work). Thankfully, Jesus says "us" not "I", so I should be able
to do this with other people being the target of interest
 
A more dangerous one that also exists there is the provisioning of daily resources.
Which is similar to tests above. Although I enjoy playing with that concept over
time.

The coming of the kingdom of God and the enactment of God's will asks what are
the measurable outcomes of the kingdom of God and what is God's will. The forgiving
of sins is difficult to measure (although might not be impossible, if I went to
the holy of holies in a tabernacle I should disintegrate). Delivering is also
difficult to measure.

## 29/4/2019
Oh my oh my oh my.

I've been thinking a lot about baysian statistics, and I realized that I now
have a rough idea of how I can actually, formally, give an attempt at proving the
existance of God. Only downside is that it could also turn me into the antichrist,
it just depends on where the truth lies.

So, the first art comes in generating hypothesis that can be tested. The goal of
this study (or now, meta-study) is to try and test the existance of God. The main
way I see in doing this is trialing whether there are things that we can 
apparently observe that could not be explained by any other hypothesis. Say for
instance, me praying for another to reduce their sins and they actually do consistently.
There is little way that this can be explained outside of divine intervention,
and would consist of strong evidence for the hypothesis of the existance of God.
Alternatively, if I keep doing tests that prove that if God exists, and the universe
behaves in exactly the same way that it would if God didn't intervene, then he 
operates either operates in a fashion that we very much don't expect or, more
simply, doesn't exist. Although [absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnS2WYLCGJP2kQkRn/absence-of-evidence-is-evidence-of-absence),
it would at the very least be evidence that God doesn't behave in the ways that
we expect in Christianity.


So, if we are to represent this understanding that we can test as a baysian network.

Pr(God exists) -> Pr(God lets me test on him|God exists) -> Pr(God allows [test] to succeed | God lets me test on him)

This obviously branches hugely on the third node. But I can eliminate nodes by
conducting tests.

The next step is to fill out some of these probabilities.

If this comes out to be true, I would probably be interested in convincing an
atheist (or more atheists) about this chain of reasoning, or get them to perform
the tests themselves. So I want to set a Pr(God exists) to that of an atheists
position, maybe 0.01. If I wanted to make this more specific, I could try and get
a collection of atheists and ask them for probabilities that God exists.

Pr(God lets me test on him|God exists) is an unfortunate idea that ["you shall not
put the lord your god to the test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_4:7), which might seem like a statistical test to some.
I am going to put this at 0.02, because [Elijah himself puts God to the test in
the way I am refering to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah#Challenge_to_Baal). I think when Jesus said "do not put the lord your God
to the test", he was not refering to scientific tests, but more getting God to
do things that are against his will in order to prove his existance. An example
of this would be asking God "If you are real, put a million dollars into my bank
account now", or in Jesus' case "If you are real, save me from jumping off a cliff".
Both would provide enourmous evidence of the case that God is real, but would be
against his will in both cases. There is however a chance that no tests are allowed
to be performed. There is a little ringing in the back of my mind that not letting
any tests to succeed can be circumvented and even tested to be true, in ways that
are similar to [extracting truth out of someone when you don't know if they will
lie or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves). I can't think of what the test would be off the top of my head but
I don't want to throw that one out.

The third depends on the hypothesis to be tested. Say for instance, it is
"Praying to help prevent temptations will kill temptations". Then this would be likely
to succeed if God allows me to test on him. This is the "theological relevance"
of the test. "Praying will help increase arbitrary probabilistic outcomes" has
a very low value here, because if God let me test on him, he probably would not
let that test to succeed. This would probably be exactly what is refered to by
"Do not put the lord your God to the test". Notably, for a test to succeed, it must
be God's will also.

I could find out what is God's will systematically by a survey of a group of christians.
This would actually fulfill my homework. I'll create such a survey and bring it
to the Bellbrae Church tonight and the Anglican church on Sunday.
